i have no clue wtf im doing

use minecraft keybind system to set open gui keybind

requires fabric api and fabric language kotlin mods


This mod was a part of another client. It has since been forcefully ripped out by the evil AI overlords gemini and claude, then put here. Chances of issues are really high.


Quick notes on how it works because writing documentation is not my thing:

You create a collection, and inside that collection you can save any item. Renaming collections is not supported right now (but can be done in the file directory by changing file names)

You can create tags and apply them to specific items, right now the only functionality for this is displaying maps from specific servers.

By applying a server tag to a map, that map will display the mapID from that server.

Supports both grid and list view for the items, clicking on them will allow you to view more information about it.

The edit component button is disabled because the screen is very broken at the moment

Open map Screen will display all maps saved.

Video guide maybe soon...
